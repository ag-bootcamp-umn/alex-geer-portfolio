# Alex Geer Portfolio 
## Description
This project is to take the first steps toward building a portfolio to showcase my work for future employers. The portfolio in its current state (December 2023) displays my skills working with semantic HTML, and CSS properties such as variables, flexbox and media queries.

The Projects linked in the portfolio are indeed my own, including two real-world websites built and deployed for clients, and one 'mock site' (DKG Landscaping) which I built to practice SASS.
